# DOStickyNote
A sticky note application with basic functionality and formatting.

This application's purpose is to demonstrate a very rudimentary sticky note.  It utilizes a custom file extension (.SYN) to help with typographical emphasis and other formatting.  Although there is no taskbar icon that is available (meaning it may be hard to pull the GUI up if it's hidden behind another application), there is a button on the top which can be pressed to keep the sticky note above all other applications at all times.  Additionally, opening the .exe file will always open a new instance of the program.  To recover/ open a file, the user must open the same file though the "Open" or "Upload" buttons.  This README will be updated when I can correct it.
